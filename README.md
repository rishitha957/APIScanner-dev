# What is API*Scanner*
1. API*Scanner* is Visual Studio Code extension, that highlights the deprecated API elements used in python language.
2. The current version only detects deprecated APIs present in six python frameworks - *Scikit-learn*, *Numpy*, *Matplotlib*, *Pandas*, *Scipy*, *Seaborn*.

# Features of API*Scanner*
1. Identifies the deprecated API elements present in the current active editor.
2. On hover, hovercard pop-up shows the information regarding the deprecation (such as version in which it has been deprecated and any available replacement message provided by the library developer).

# Uses of API*Scanner*
1. Deprecated APIs are discouraged from being used in further software developments.
2. To help developers mitigate the usage of deprecated APIs during new software developments, the developer must be aware of the usage of deprecated APIs in the project.
3. Manually detecting and replacing deprecated APIs is a tedious and time-consuming task due to the large number of API calls used in the projects.
4. With the help of API*Scanner* developers can identify the deprecated APIs in the developing phase.
